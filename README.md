## Theme of Submission ðŸ—Š 
The inspiration Kairos came from the theme of **Digital Empowerment** with the challenge statement - **"Singapore is advancing its smart city initiatives within a compact urban environment. Create a solution to enhance commuter experiences."**


<br>
Overview
<br>
As we believe that travelling can be fuss-free and enjoyable, we decided to focus on **digital empowerment through personalised commuter experience** and created **KAIROS TRAVEL BOT** to ease the travelling experience for commuters. 

<br>
<br>

**Pain Points** 
<br>	
Society is undergoing a lifestyle shift towards personalised experiences. However, Singapore's smart city initiatives are not meeting this demand for commuters. Despite the city's compact and fast-paced urban environment, commuters scontinue to spend time navigating multiple apps to find the best commuting schedule. While apps such as Google Maps offer optimal routes, they fail to cater personalized schedules tailored to individual needs.

<br>
<br>

**Solutions**
<br>
With these key issues and the perspective of frequent commuters in our minds, we set our sights on addressing the pain points of commuter experience. We built KAIROS TRAVEL BOT to demonstrate the potential of an efficient travel bot for frequent commuters. This bot leverages existing products such as google map to enhance and simplify the commuting experience in several ways:

**Speech-to-Route Translation Using Large Language Models**: Using large language models, the bot allows users to verbally request route information, making it convenient for those who are on the go or prefer hands-free interaction.

**Personalized Route Optimization**: The bot offers routes tailored to individual preferences, such as minimising the number of transfers, walking distance, or travel time.

**Proactive Alerts**: The bot sends notifications and alerts about any potential issues on the user's regular routes, such as delays or maintenance work, helping them stay informed and prepared.

**Saved Frequent Routes**: The bot enables users to save their most commonly used routes for quick access, streamlining the process of planning daily commutes.

Through these features, KAIROS TRAVEL BOT aims to make commuting more efficient and less stressful, demonstrating how technology can be harnessed to improve daily travel experiences for frequent commuters.
